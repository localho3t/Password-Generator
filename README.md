## Password Generator

This is a simple project to create a password with Java.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Run Project
```bash
java -c bin/ App length count
java -c bin/ App 50 3
```


> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `Password Generator` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
